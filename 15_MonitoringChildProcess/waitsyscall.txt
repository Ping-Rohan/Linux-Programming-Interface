The wait() system call does the following:

1. If no (previously unwaited-for) child of the calling process has yet terminated,
the call blocks until one of the children terminates. If a child has already termi-
nated by the time of the call, wait() returns immediately.

2. If status is not NULL, information about how the child terminated is returned in
the integer to which status points. We describe the information returned in status
3. The kernel adds the process CPU times  and resource usage statistics
to running totals for all children of this parent process.

4. As its function result, wait() returns the process ID of the child that has terminated.

5. wait system calls returns -1 if no child are running or already exited, returns ECHILD errno
